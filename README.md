I'm currently a Master's student at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand.

I am doing a thesis in machine learning, training and applying [transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)) models using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). In my free time, I build [my programming language](https://github.com/maxeonyx/kal) using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), go rock climbing, and dabble in [game development](https://maxeonyx.itch.io/) with the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine.

I am involved in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), a social movement which asks how we can do the most good for the world with our resources. I want to use my career to help solve the world's most pressing problems.
